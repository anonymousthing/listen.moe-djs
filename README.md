# ~Official~ Listen.moe discord bot

The ~official~ deprecated discord bot that streams from [listen.moe](https://listen.moe) to your discord server. Check out the migrated project over [here](https://github.com/WeebDev/Listen.moe-Discord)!

## Usage

- After you've added the bot to your server, join a voice channel and type `~~join` to bind the bot to that channel. You need to have the "Manage server" permission to use this command.
- At any time, anyone can use the "Now playing" command to see what song is being played and who requested it.
- The bot's "game" will alternate between the server count and the currently playing song every 15 seconds.

## Command list

This list assumes a prefix of `~~`.

- `~~join`
  Type this while in a voice channel to have the bot join that channel and start playing there. Limited to users with the "manage server" permission.

- `~~leave`
  Makes the bot leave the voice channel it's currently in.

- `~~np`
  Gets the currently playing song and artist. If the song was requested by someone, also gives their name and a link to their profile on forum.listen.moe.

- `~~help`
  Shows a real basic usage help which is the same one that appears the first time the bot joins a guild.

- `~~ignore`
  Ignores commands in the current channel. Admin commands are exempt from the ignore.

- `~~unignore`
  Unignores commands in the current channel.
  
- `~~ignore all`
  Ignores commands in all channels on the guild.
  
- `~~unignore all`
  Unignores all channels on the guild.

- `~~prefix <new prefix>`
  Changes the bot's prefix for this server. Prefixes cannot contain whitespace, letters, or numbers - anything else is fair game. It's recommended that you stick with the default prefix of `~~`, but this command is provided in case you find conflicts with other bots.

## Run it yourself

NodeJS version 7+ is required. 

- Clone the repo.
- Create a Discord OAuth application and bot account.
- Rename/duplicate `config-sample.json` to `config.json` and fill out the relevant information.
- Install dependencies from npm.
- Install ffmpeg - if on Windows, make sure to add it to your PATH.
- Run the bot with `node --harmony listenmoe.js` or if you use pm2 `pm2 start listenmoe.js --node-args="--harmony"`
